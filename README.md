# Networth tracker project in C#

This is a simple networth tracker that I am building using C# and ASP.NET MVC 4 technology.

Eventually, this web application will allow you to save the value of your investments on a monthly basis so that you can see how your overall portfolio is doing.

### TODO
- Add a section on upcoming features
- Add a section on how somebody can build this on their own machine

### Features to work on
- Use Ninject or some IoC container
- Use automappers to map viewmodels to models
- Use more view models
- better UI to input data
- graph asset values over time
- use a different bootstrap theme
